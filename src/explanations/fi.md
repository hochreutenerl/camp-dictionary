## Symbolism
Finnish scouts use brown or blue (seldom green) uniforms. The different colours are due to some historical differences.

Most groups wear the uniform only to specials events (like camp opening, celebrations, parades, etc.) and therefore kept clean.

Every local group has its own scarf: [List of local groups and its scarves](https://fi.scoutwiki.org/Luokka:Huivikuvat)

## Badges

Every age group has it own badges and awards.

[Regulations for badges](https://www.partio.fi/partiolaiselle/apua-ja-ohjeita/partioasu-ja-merkit/)

In short:  
Younger groups (Sudenpennut, Seikkailijat and Tarpojat) regularly attain "participation badges", at least every 6 month.
These badges together often form a bigger "badge".  
When the participants reach the next age group, he has to remove the badges of the previous age group but can place a metal badge on the shirt.

For older groups (Samoajat, Vaeltajat, Aikuiset) many of the badges and insignias are more challenging to attain.
