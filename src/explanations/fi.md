## Activities
Typical activities in a Finnish group are:
 * programme during a weekday evening
 * ca. 4 - 8 group weekends (Friday - Sunday) a year
 * camps during school holidays
 * regional and national competitions

## Specialities
There are a few things that are unique to groups in Finland:
 * most camps have a sauna
 * heated tents in winter
 * camps and weekends in winter are not uncommon
 * väiski: a traditional had in the Finnish national colours
 * every scout owns a bag with his own cutlery, often this bag is decorated with badges from events
 
## Languages
Finland has two official languages: Finnish (94%) and Swedish (5%). In addition there is a Sami speaking minority in Lapland.

In partio (the biggest scouting organisation) the distribution is as follows: Finnish (93%), Swedish (6%), Inari Sami (1%).   
Although Swedish speaking groups are scattered around the country, they form their own district within the organisation.
   
## Age Structure
All local groups have subgroups of the same age structure:

## Symbolism
Finnish scouts mostly use brown or blue uniforms. The different colours are due to some historical differences,
like a more outdoor focused programme (eräpartio) or different organisations which were fusioned.

Most groups wear the uniform only to specials events (like camp opening, celebrations, parades, etc.) and are therefore kept clean and formally.

Every local group has its own scarf: [List of local groups and its scarves](https://fi.scoutwiki.org/Luokka:Huivikuvat)

## Badges

Every age group has it own badges and awards.

[Regulations for badges](https://www.partio.fi/partiolaiselle/apua-ja-ohjeita/partioasu-ja-merkit/)

In short:  
Younger groups (Sudenpennut, Seikkailijat and Tarpojat) regularly attain "participation badges", at least every 6 month.
These badges together often form a bigger symbol.  
When the participants reach the next age group, they have to remove the badges of the previous age group but recieve a metal badge instead.

For older groups (Samoajat, Vaeltajat, Aikuiset) many of the badges and awards are by far more challenging to attain.
