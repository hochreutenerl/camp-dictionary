*Disclaimer: This discription is mainly about Swiss YMCA-scouts (Cevi) in the german speaking part of Switzerland.
Descriptions may differ for other organisations, languages or even regions.*

## Activities
Typical activities in a Swiss group are:
 * Programme on Saturday afternoon (14:00 - 17:00)
 * Camps during school holidays
 * Regional (seldom national) leadership courses and fun events

## Specialities
There are a few things that are unique to groups in Switzerland:
 * tents made out of cotton tarps (Zeltblache), can be combined to huge structures
 * many groups cook all their meals on the fire
 * big games in the forest (Geländespiel)
 * camp construction (Lagerbau) is a big part of every camp, many of these have major self built structures
 * districts and local groups define their structure and activities (like age groups, programme content, courses) completely themselves
 * group members and leaders are in generally rather young
 * the "Federal Office of Sport" stronlgy supports camps with material and funds (as long as leaders visit courses and let their programme be cheked)
  
## Languages
Switzerland has four official languages: German (63%), French (23%), Italian (8%) and Romansh (1%)

In Swiss YMCA the distribution is as follows: German (95%), French (4%), Romansh (1%).  
Most information is therefore only available German and limited in French.
  
## Age Structure
In most local groups the member of the groups stay together even though they change the "age group".

This leads to a big variety in structures between the local groups.

Name                              | Minimal age | Maximal age
---                               | ---         | ---
Fröschli (introduction programme) | ca. 4       | ca. 6
Participants                      | ca. 6       | 12 - 17
Leaders (minor tasks)             | 13-18       | 18
Leaders (major responsibilities)  | 18          | (no official maximal age, but only few people are over the age of 28)

## Symbolism
Swiss YMCA-scouts use blue uniforms. It is worn to almost all activities of the group.  
Some scouts "decorate" or "destroy" their shirt with various colours or self printed emblems on the back.

Every local group has its own scarf: [List of local groups and its scarves](https://www.cevi-krawatte.ch/)  
Very often scarves are hanged into the should flap, with exception for the national scarf.

## Badges

Younger (-12) participants have the possibility to attain the "Cevibeweis" or "Krawattenprüfung".

There are 9 proficiency badges which can be attained at regional courses and seldom at local group events.

## Courses

Switzerland has a very detailed and diverse course system.

Courses for older leaders are organised in cooperation with "Youth + Sports",
which also supports camps organised in this programme.


### Courses for participants / younger leaders (dt. "Untere Kursreihe")
